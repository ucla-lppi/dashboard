# Additional RESOURCES

The purpose of the first iteration of our project is to present foundational data about extreme heat and air pollution in majority Latino neighborhoods in 23 California counties. However, we acknowledge that extreme heat and air pollution, and environmental exposure generally, are experienced very differently amongst various identities. Although we were unable to explore the data for other groups due to project scope, we recognize that certain populations are more vulnerable to climate and health disparities.
