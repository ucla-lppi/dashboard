# FAQ

Here is a list of common questions and answers you may have as you explore the Latino Climate and Health Dashboard. Many common questions about the methods and indicators used to develop the Latino Climate and Health Dashboard can be found here or in the “Our Data” [LINK] section. Please refer to the technical report [LINK] for detailed information on our methods and data sources.

Q: How is “Latino” defined, and what groups does the term include?
A: The Latino Climate and Health Dashboard follows the U.S. Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) definition of “Latino” to ensure consistency with government data sources. According to the OMB, Hispanic or Latino refers to “a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.”

This includes 20 Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas and Spain. While we follow the federal definition, we recognize that Latino identity is diverse and evolving. Terms like “Latino” or “Hispanic” may not reflect everyone’s identity. 

Q: How is non-Latino white defined?
A: “Non-Latino white” (NL white) refers to individuals who identify as white but not as Hispanic or Latino. According to the U.S. Census Bureau and American Community Survey (ACS), white is defined as “a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.” 

Q: Why are there only factsheets for 23 counties in California?
A: The 23 counties selected for analysis were chosen because they met at least one of the following criteria: 

Number of Latino-Majority Census Tracts
Counties were ranked by the number of census tracts where Latinos make up more than 70% of the population. The 20 counties with the most Latino-majority census tracts were included.
Total Latino Population
Counties were ranked by their total Latino population. The 20 counties with the highest Latino populations were included.

Together, the 23 selected counties represent 93% of California’s Latino population, providing a comprehensive coverage of the state’s Latino population. 

For more information on how we selected the 23 counties included in the dashboard and for a full list of the counties, please refer to our technical report [LINK].

Q: How should I cite the Latino Climate and Health Dashboard?
A: Use the following format: Latino Climate and Health Dashboard. (Year). “Page Title.” [URL]

Example: Latino Climate and Health Dashboard. (2025). “Los Angeles County: Extreme Heat.” [website URL]

Q: What is an indicator?  
A: An indicator is a data-driven measure used to describe conditions. In our dashboard, we highlight environmental, health, and socioeconomic indicators to identify patterns, disparities, and areas in need of policy intervention. 

Q: What is a neighborhood?
A: In our factsheets, a neighborhood refers to a census tract. Defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, census tracts are geographic units with populations ranging from 2,500 to 8,000 people. 

Q: How are Latino, non-Latino white, and non-Latino neighborhoods defined?
We define neighborhoods based on census tracts where a majority of residents identify with a specific group:
Latino neighborhoods: More than 70% of residents identify as Latino. 
Non-Latino white neighborhoods: More than 70% of residents identify as non-Latino white. 
Non-Latino neighborhoods: In Imperial, Kings, and Merced counties, there are no census tracts that meet the 70% non-Latino white threshold. Therefore, all census tracts without a Latino population greater than 70% are categorized as non-Latino neighborhoods for these three counties. 
Note: In Sacramento County, there are no census tracts with a Latino population greater than 70%. Therefore, Latino neighborhoods in Sacramento County are defined as census tracts where more than 50% of residents are Latino. For consistency, non-Latino white neighborhoods in Sacramento County are also defined by a 50% threshold. Despite not having census tracts with a 70%+ Latino population, Sacramento was included in the dashboard because it is the ninth county with the highest Latino population in California.

For more information on how we define neighborhoods, please refer to the Technical Report [LINK].

Q: How is each indicator calculated, and where are the indicators sourced from?
A: Each indicator is sourced from free publicly available datasets. Common sources include:

The Census’ American Community Survey (ACS) for demographic and socioeconomic data.
The State of California's CalEnviroScreen 4.0 for environmental indicators.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for public health data.

See the Our Data section [LINK] or our technical report [LINK] for more information on our methods and data sources. 

Q: How were the indicators selected?  
A: Indicators were selected based on data accessibility, geographic precision, and timeliness. We prioritized:
Census tract-level data for neighborhood-level insights.
Data sources with consistent census tract boundaries (i.e., 2010 or 2020).
California-specific datasets to ensure local policy relevance for community action.
Datasets with the most up-to-date reporting year to reflect current environmental and health conditions. 

See our technical report [LINK] for more specific information on how we selected the indicators. 

Q: How are communities represented geographically?  
A: Our dashboard presents data at both the county and census tract levels:

At the county level, we present statistics for Latino and non-Latino white populations. 
At the census tract level (i.e. neighborhoods), we present data for Latino and non-Latino white, and non-Latino neighborhoods (click here for more information on how we define different neighborhood types).   

Q: How can I access the raw data?
A: The Latino Climate and Health Dashboard provides key insights through county factsheets, but users seeking raw data can access:
Our GitHub repository [LINK] where we share the datasets used in our analysis
Official data sources listed in the Technical Report 

Q: Will more factsheets or geographic areas be added to the dashboard?
A: Currently, the Latino Climate and Health Dashboard includes factsheets for 23 California counties selected based on their Latino populations ([click here for more on county selection]). We plan to update the dashboard over time by adding new environmental and health indicators, as well as expanding to additional counties or states.
